VBEM
====

This repository includes some MATLAB scripts comprising the core algorithm of the AR1MA1-VBEM method described in:

* [Methods and Recent Patents for Modeling and Uncovering GRNs](http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/2210686311202020088)
* [Microarray Time Series Modeling and Variational Bayesian Method for Reverse Engineering GRNs](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-11629-7_10)

to perform Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) reverse engineering form gene expression time series.

Despite the method was originally developed to use microarray data, we are working to update it to handle RNA-Seq data and improve it with an user interface.
