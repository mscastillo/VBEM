VBEM
====

This repository includes some MATLAB scripts comprising the core algorithms of the AR1MA1-VBEM method described in the 4th chapter of my PhD dissertation, entitled: *[Bayesian methods for inferring GRNs and protein profiles from gene expression microarrays data](http://www.ugr.es/~mscastillo)*, to perform Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) reverse engineering from gene expression time series data.

Despite the method was originally developed to use microarray data and some results have been published in:

* [Methods and Recent Patents for Modeling and Uncovering GRNs](http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/2210686311202020088)
* [Microarray Time Series Modeling and Variational Bayesian Method for Reverse Engineering GRNs](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-11629-7_10)

we are working to update it for handling RNA-Seq data and we are improving it with a user interface. Hopefully, a new publication in an well rated journal will be released soon.
