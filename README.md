AR1MA1-VBEM
===========

This repository includes some MATLAB scripts comprising the core algorithms of the AR1MA1-VBEM method described in the 4th chapter of my PhD dissertation, entitled:

> *Bayesian methods for inferring GRNs and protein profiles from gene expression microarrays data*, 2012, ISBN: [978-84-9028-501-5](http://cul.worldcat.org/oclc/870124049)

to perform Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) reverse engineering from gene expression time series data.

An early VBEM approach, based on a *first-order autoregresive* (AR1) model, was published in:

> *A Survey of Statistical Models for Reverse Engineering Gene Regulatory Networks*, 2009, DOI: [10.1109/MSP.2008.930647](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109%2FMSP.2008.930647)

The present version improves the previous approach by introducing a *first-order autoregresive first-order moving-average* (AR1MA1) model that fits better the noisy nature of the data. We are updating the current version of the method to (*i*) handle RNA-Seq as well as microarray data and (*ii*) to improve it with a friendly user-interface. Hopefully, a new publication in a well rated journal will be released soon.
