AR1MA1-VBEM
===========

This repository includes some MATLAB scripts comprising the core algorithms of the AR1MA1-VBEM method described in the 4th chapter of my PhD dissertation, entitled:

> *Bayesian methods for inferring GRNs and protein profiles from gene expression microarrays data*, Manuel Sanchez Castillo (2012), ISBN: [978-84-9028-501-5](http://cul.worldcat.org/oclc/870124049)

to perform Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) reverse engineering from gene expression time series data.

An early VBEM approach, based on an AR1 linear model, was published in:

>*A Survey of Statistical Models for Reverse Engineering Gene Regulatory Networks*, Y. Huan et al., IEEE Signal Processing Magazine (2009), DOI: [10.1109/MSP.2008.930647](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109%2FMSP.2008.930647)

This current version improves the previous approach by introducing an AR1MA1 linear model that fits better the noisy nature of the data. We are updating the current version of the AR1MA1-VBEM method to (*i*) handle RNA-Seq as well as microarray data and (*ii*) to improve it with a user interface.

Hopefully, a new publication in a well rated journal will be released soon.
